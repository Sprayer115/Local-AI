Today's Menu:
----------------

- Vegetable Curry with Basmati Rice (Main Course)
- Tomato and Mozzarella Salad (Side Dish)
- Seasonal Fruit (Dessert)

Tomorrow's Menu:
-----------------

- Penne Pomodoro with Grilled Veggies (Main Course)
- Greek Salad with Feta Cheese (Side Dish)
- Mango Lassi (Dessert)

For today, I would recommend trying the Vegetable Curry with Basmati Rice. It's a hearty and flavorful dish that is sure to satisfy your hunger. If you still have room for dessert, the Seasonal Fruit is a healthy and refreshing option.

For tomorrow, I suggest going for the Penne Pomodoro with Grilled Veggies. This pasta dish is made with fresh ingredients and has a delicious tomato sauce that vegetarians will love. The Greek Salad with Feta Cheese is a great side dish to complement your meal, and the Mango Lassi is a tasty way to finish off your lunch.

To get more information about each dish, such as nutritional facts or ingredients, you can use the Mensa's online tool or app. This will help you make an informed decision about what to eat based on your dietary needs and preferences.</span>

Today's Menu:
----------------

- Vegetable Curry with Basmati Rice (Main Course)

- Seasonal Fruit (Dessert)

Tomorrow's Menu:
-----------------

- Penne Pomodoro with Grilled Veggies (Main Course)
- Greek Salad with Feta Cheese (Side Dish)
- Mango Lassi (Dessert)

For today, I would recommend trying the Vegetable Curry with Basmati Rice. It's a hearty and flavorful dish that is sure to satisfy your hunger. If you still have room for dessert, the Seasonal Fruit is a healthy and refreshing option.

For tomorrow, I suggest going for the Penne Pomodoro with Grilled Veggies. This pasta dish is made with fresh ingredients and has a delicious tomato sauce that vegetarians will love. The Greek Salad with Feta Cheese is a great side dish to complement your meal, and the Mango Lassi is a tasty way to finish off your lunch.

Today's Menu:
----------------

- Vegetable Curry with Basmati Rice (Main Course)
- Tomato and Mozzarella Salad (Side Dish)
- Seasonal Fruit (Dessert)

Tomorrow's Menu:
-----------------

- Penne Pomodoro with Grilled Veggies (Main Course)
- Greek Salad with Feta Cheese (Side Dish)
- Mango Lassi (Dessert)

For today, I would recommend trying the Vegetable Curry with Basmati Rice. It's a hearty and flavorful dish that is sure to satisfy your hunger. If you still have room for dessert, the Seasonal Fruit is a healthy and refreshing option.

For tomorrow, I suggest going for the Penne Pomodoro with Grilled Veggies. This pasta dish is made with fresh ingredients and has a delicious tomato sauce that vegetarians will love. The Greek Salad with Feta Cheese is a great side dish to complement your meal, and the Mango Lassi is a tasty way to finish off your lunch.

To get more information about each dish, such as nutritional facts or ingredients, you can use the Mensa's online tool or app. This will help you make an informed decision about what to eat based on your dietary needs and preferences.</span>

                                            <span class="full-text" style="display: none;">certainly! I've checked both the weather forecast and the mensa menu plans for HTWG Konstanz next week, and here are my integrated recommendations for your outdoor event planning:

**Monday:** The high temperature will be around 16¬∞C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving vegetable curry with rice and a side salad. This would be a great option for your event since warm dishes like curry are perfect for slightly cooler temperatures, and the side salad can add some refreshing crunch to balance out the meal.

**Tuesday:** The high temperature will be around 19¬∞C with sunny skies. The mensa is serving fried noodles with vegetables and chicken. This dish would be a great option for your outdoor event since it's easy to eat and doesn't require any utensils, making it perfect for a casual gathering outside.

**Wednesday:** The high temperature will be around 21¬∞C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving baked potatoes with different toppings such as cheese, sour cream, and vegetables. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's easy to serve and eat, and the warm potatoes can provide some comfort on a slightly cooler day.

**Thursday:** The high temperature will be around 23¬∞C with sunny skies. The mensa is serving stuffed bell peppers with rice and a side salad. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's flavorful, colorful, and can provide some visual appeal to your gathering.

**Friday:** The high temperature will be around 24¬∞C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving pizza with different toppings. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's easy to eat and share, and the variety of toppings can accommodate different dietary preferences and restrictions.

In general, I would recommend planning for some backup options in case the weather turns out to be colder or hotter than expected. Consider having some blankets or heaters available if the temperature drops, or providing some cold drinks and shade if it gets too hot. Also, make sure to check with HTWG Konstanz regarding any specific rules or guidelines for hosting outdoor events on their campus.</span>

                                            <span class="full-text" style="display: none;">The tool selection was appropriate as both weather and mensa tools were used to provide comprehensive planning information for an outdoor event at HTWG Konstanz. Unnecessary tools were avoided. The parameter accuracy was good as the correct forecast parameters were checked for the specified location, and the correct dates and times were used to retrieve the mensa menu plans. The results were correctly interpreted, integrated into the response, and the final answer was based on tool results. Error handling was demonstrated when suggesting backup options in case of unexpected weather conditions, and appropriate fallback behavior was shown by recommending blankets or heaters for colder temperatures and cold drinks and shade for hotter temperatures. However, there was no clear communication of any potential errors that may have occurred during the process, which slightly impacts the score. Overall, an excellent display of tool usage accuracy in this context.</span>

                                            <span class="full-text" style="display: none;">certainly! I've checked both the weather forecast and the mensa menu plans for HTWG Konstanz next week, and here are my integrated recommendations for your outdoor event planning:

**Monday:** The high temperature will be around 16¬∞C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving vegetable curry with rice and a side salad. This would be a great option for your event since warm dishes like curry are perfect for slightly cooler temperatures, and the side salad can add some refreshing crunch to balance out the meal.

**Tuesday:** The high temperature will be around 19¬∞C with sunny skies. The mensa is serving fried noodles with vegetables and chicken. This dish would be a great option for your outdoor event since it's easy to eat and doesn't require any utensils, making it perfect for a casual gathering outside.

**Wednesday:** The high temperature will be around 21¬∞C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving baked potatoes with different toppings such as cheese, sour cream, and vegetables. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's easy to serve and eat, and the warm potatoes can provide some comfort on a slightly cooler day.

**Thursday:** The high temperature will be around 23¬∞C with sunny skies. The mensa is serving stuffed bell peppers with rice and a side salad. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's flavorful, colorful, and can provide some visual appeal to your gathering.

**Friday:** The high temperature will be around 24¬∞C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving pizza with different toppings. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's easy to eat and share, and the variety of toppings can accommodate different dietary preferences and restrictions.

In general, I would recommend planning for some backup options in case the weather turns out to be colder or hotter than expected. Consider having some blankets or heaters available if the temperature drops, or providing some cold drinks and shade if it gets too hot. Also, make sure to check with HTWG Konstanz regarding any specific rules or guidelines for hosting outdoor events on their campus.</span>

                                            <span class="full-text" style="display: none;">certainly! I've checked both the weather forecast and the mensa menu plans for HTWG Konstanz next week, and here are my integrated recommendations for your outdoor event planning:

**Monday:** The high temperature will be around 16¬∞C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving vegetable curry with rice and a side salad. This would be a great option for your event since warm dishes like curry are perfect for slightly cooler temperatures, and the side salad can add some refreshing crunch to balance out the meal.

**Tuesday:** The high temperature will be around 19¬∞C with sunny skies. The mensa is serving fried noodles with vegetables and chicken. This dish would be a great option for your outdoor event since it's easy to eat and doesn't require any utensils, making it perfect for a casual gathering outside.

**Wednesday:** The high temperature will be around 21¬∞C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving baked potatoes with different toppings such as cheese, sour cream, and vegetables. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's easy to serve and eat, and the warm potatoes can provide some comfort on a slightly cooler day.

**Thursday:** The high temperature will be around 23¬∞C with sunny skies. The mensa is serving stuffed bell peppers with rice and a side salad. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's flavorful, colorful, and can provide some visual appeal to your gathering.

**Friday:** The high temperature will be around 24¬∞C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving pizza with different toppings. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's easy to eat and share, and the variety of toppings can accommodate different dietary preferences and restrictions.

In general, I would recommend planning for some backup options in case the weather turns out to be colder or hotter than expected. Consider having some blankets or heaters available if the temperature drops, or providing some cold drinks and shade if it gets too hot. Also, make sure to check with HTWG Konstanz regarding any specific rules or guidelines for hosting outdoor events on their campus.</span>

I've checked both the weather forecast and the mensa menu plans for HTWG Konstanz next week, and here are my integrated recommendations for your outdoor event planning:\n\n**Monday:** The high temperature will be around 16\u00b0C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving vegetable curry with rice and a side salad. This would be a great option for your event since warm dishes like curry are perfect for slightly cooler temperatures, and the side salad can add some refreshing crunch to balance out the meal.\n\n**Tuesday:** The high temperature will be around 19\u00b0C with sunny skies. The mensa is serving fried noodles with vegetables and chicken. This dish would be a great option for your outdoor event since it's easy to eat and doesn't require any utensils, making it perfect for a casual gathering outside.\n\n**Wednesday:** The high temperature will be around 21\u00b0C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving baked potatoes with different toppings such as cheese, sour cream, and vegetables. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's easy to serve and eat, and the warm potatoes can provide some comfort on a slightly cooler day.\n\n**Thursday:** The high temperature will be around 23\u00b0C with sunny skies. The mensa is serving stuffed bell peppers with rice and a side salad. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's flavorful, colorful, and can provide some visual appeal to your gathering.\n\n**Friday:** The high temperature will be around 24\u00b0C with partly cloudy skies. The mensa is serving pizza with different toppings. This dish would be a great option for your event since it's easy to eat and share, and the variety of toppings can accommodate different dietary preferences and restrictions.\n\nIn general, I would recommend planning for some backup options in case the weather turns out to be colder or hotter than expected.
